#QuizzyGoose

Inspiration
QuizzyGoose was inspired by a common problem encountered by students, burnout and procrastination. We found that the hardest part of studying was usually starting. To tackle this, we gamified learning so that it provided the instant gratification that all uni students crave.

#What it does
What QuizzyGoose does is it uses Gemini to generate multiple choice questions from your notes! Providing a quick and easy way to test your understanding. Additionally, it has a room and login system for working with others. The app was developed with flask, js, html, css, bootstrap, github mongodb and jinja.

#Challenges we ran into
A challenge that we encountered was difficulty in finding a suitable AI for us to use and constructing a prompt that produced the desired outcome. We also had difficulty with working synchronously and testing our code on each of our own devices.

#Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are particularly proud of our UI and the AI generation of question and answer sets. We learnt many things in the span of 24 hours. We developed our knowledge of web-development technologies (flask,bootstrap,etc.), use of version control software and integrating an AI API.

#What's next for QuizzyGoose
The next steps for QuizzyGoose, provided with more time, would be to implement a better co-operative and social learning system, as well as more geese!
